        "content": "\n\n\nThis is a brown-bag release following insufficient restrictions on allowable `tensorflow` versions for the \"pypi\" extra `sleap[pypi]` in 1.3.2. While the conda packages for 1.3.2 were not affected (since `tensorflow` is pulled in from anaconda), the PyPI only package installed via `pip install sleap[pypi]` had conflicts between the version of `tensorflow` and the version of `keras`. See [1.3.0](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/releases/tag/v1.3.0), [1.3.1](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/releases/tag/v1.3.1), and  [1.3.2](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/releases/tag/v1.3.2) for previous notable changes. \n\n**From 1.3.2+, to install SLEAP through pip use `pip install sleap[pypi]` to ensure all dependencies are gathered.**\n\nAs a reminder:\n\n> The 1.3.1 dependency update requires [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for faster dependency resolution. If you already have anaconda installed, then you _can_ set the solver to libmamba in the base environment:\n>```\n>conda update -n base conda\n>conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver\n>conda config --set solver libmamba\n>```\n>Any subsequent `mamba` commands in the docs will need to be replaced with `conda` if you choose to use your existing Anaconda installation. \n>\n>Otherwise, follow the [recommended installation instruction for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\n\n### Quick install\n**`mamba` (Windows/Linux/GPU)**:\n```\nmamba create -y -n sleap -c conda-forge -c nvidia -c sleap -c anaconda sleap=1.3.3\n```\n\n**`mamba` (Mac)**:\n```\nmamba create -y -n sleap -c conda-forge -c anaconda -c sleap sleap=1.3.3\n```\n\n**`pip` (any OS except Apple Silicon)**:\n```\npip install sleap[pypi]==1.3.3\n```\n\n### Full Changelog\n\n##### Fixes\n* Do not try to remove item if already deleted by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1498\n* Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on mamba activate by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1496\n* Reset `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on deactivate by @roomrys in #1502\n\n##### Dependencies\n* Add version restirctions to tendorflow for pypi by @roomrys in #1485\n* Remove `imageio` pin by @roomrys in #1501\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3\n\n"
