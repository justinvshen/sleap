[{"title": "title1", "date": "10/12/2023", "content": "# Bulletin\n\n\n\nSLEAP 1.3.2 adds some nice usability features thanks to both the community ideas and new contributors! See [1.3.0](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/releases/tag/v1.3.0) and [1.3.1](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/releases/tag/v1.3.1) for previous notable changes. As a reminder:\n\n> The 1.3.1 dependency update requires [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for faster dependency resolution. If you already have anaconda installed, then you _can_ set the solver to libmamba in the base environment:\n>```\n>conda update -n base conda\n>conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver\n>conda config --set solver libmamba\n>```\n>Any subsequent `mamba` commands in the docs will need to be replaced with `conda` if you choose to use your existing Anaconda installation. \n>\n>Otherwise, follow the [recommended installation instruction for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\n\n**`mamba` (Windows/Linux/GPU)**:\n```\nmamba create -y -n sleap -c conda-forge -c nvidia -c sleap -c anaconda sleap=1.3.2\n```\n\n**`mamba` (Mac)**:\n```\nmamba create -y -n sleap -c conda-forge -c anaconda -c sleap sleap=1.3.2\n```\n\n**`pip` (any OS except Apple Silicon)**:\n```\npip install sleap[pypi]==1.3.2\n```\n\n* Limit max tracks via track-local queues by @shrivaths16 and @talmo in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1447\n* Add option to remove videos in batch by @gitttt-1234 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1382 and https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1406\n* Add shortcut to export analysis for current video by @KevinZ0217 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1414 and https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1444\n* Add video path and frame indices to metrics by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1396\n* Add a button for copying model config to clipboard by @KevinZ0217 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1433\n* Add Option to Export CSV by @gitttt-1234 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1438\n\n\n* Add option to remove videos in batch by @gitttt-1234 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1382 and https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1406\n* Add `Track` when add `Instance` by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1408\n* Add `Video` to cache when adding `Track` by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1407\n* Add shortcut to export analysis for current video by @KevinZ0217 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1414 and https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1444\n* Add video path and frame indices to metrics by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1396\n* Improve error message for detecting video backend by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1441\n* Add a button for copying model config to clipboard by @KevinZ0217 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1433\n* Add Option to Export CSV by @gitttt-1234 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1438\n* Limit max tracks via track-local queues by @shrivaths16 and @talmo in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1447\n\n* Minor fix in computation of OKS by @shrivaths16 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1383 and https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1399\n* Fix `Filedialog` to work across (mac)OS by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1393\n* Fix panning bounding box by @gitttt-1234 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1398\n* Fix skeleton templates by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1404\n* Fix labels export for json by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1410\n* Correct GUI state emulation by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1422\n* Update status message on status bar by @shrivaths16 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1411\n* Fix error thrown when last video is deleted  by @shrivaths16 in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1421\n* Add model folder to the unzip path by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1445\n* Fix drag and drop by @talmo in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1449\n\n* Pin micromamba version by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1376\n* Add pip extras by @roomrys in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1481\n\n* @shrivaths16 made their first contribution in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1383\n* @gitttt-1234 made their first contribution in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1382\n* @KevinZ0217 made their first contribution in https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/pull/1414\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2\n"}, {"title": "title2", "date": "10/07/2023", "content": "Old Announcment"}]
